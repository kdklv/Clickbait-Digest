**A Chrome extension that cuts through the fluff and delivers concise, factual summaries of YouTube videos, directly answering clickbait titles and distilling the core information, so you don't have to suffer through the algorithm's time-wasting tactics.**

## Project Intent

In today's digital landscape, video content often falls victim to clickbait titles and algorithmic manipulation. Creators frequently stretch the smallest kernels of information into lengthy, repetitive videos designed to maximize watch time and ad revenue. This practice, known as "algo-slop," wastes viewers' time and obscures the actual content.

* **Delegating to AI:** Letting the Gemini AI handle the algo-slop.
* **Deciphering Clickbait:** Analyzing video titles to identify the core question or assertion.
* **Extracting the Truth:** Processing video transcripts using the power of the Gemini API to extract relevant information.
